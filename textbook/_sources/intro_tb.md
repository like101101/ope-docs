## Open Source Education (OPE) Overview

The open source movement has reshaped the way we think about computing and how we create, curate and run software. We believe that the tools and processes of open source can be brought to bear on the development and distribution of educational material that are not only openly available but whoâ€™s construction, source material and use begin and remain in the public domain.

In this project so far we have developed an exemplar set of materials for an introductory computers systems class that exploits Jupyter, Jupyter Books, OpenShift and the the Mass Open Cloud to develop and deliver a unique educational experience for learning about how computer systems work.

OPE leverages modern open source technologies to create an open environment and platform in which educators can create, publish, and operationalize high-quality open source materials, while students require no more than access to a web browser to access them. To achieve this, we have built an open ownership model that starts with high-performance, open data centers providing the hardware resources. This model allows us to exploit Linux and build a rich environment of tools and services to support a novel approach to educational material.

This project has received support from the Red Hat Collaboratory Research Incubation Award program in 2022 and 2023 for the project titled Foundations in Open Source Education.

## Why OPE?

#### Accessibility in Computer Science Education

All users are granted unrestricted access to every feature of OPE, without incurring any costs. The entire spectrum of OPE functionalities are developed in open formats, and are hosted in public repositories to promote transparency and accessibility. Furthermore, the platform is deployed in a live and interactive manner, ensuring that users receive a seamless experience. From both the students' and educators' perspectives, the minimal requirement for accessing the full OPE experience is simply having access to a web browser.

#### Unified and consistent content
OPE mandates a uniform environment for all users that are in the same context, including students/learners and authors, to ensure consistency. Every user has access to identical software and packages, with the same versions, thereby eliminating the potential for issues to arise when working with disparate versions of software.

#### Limitless Customization
Customizing all features of OPE provides users with flexibility and the ability to tailor the platform based on the context of what will be teaching. The ability to customize OPE also ensures that the platform stays up-to-date and relevant, adapting to changes in technology.
